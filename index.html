        <p>Why <strong>Quoll42</strong>? A quoll is a cat-like Australian marsupial that I choose for my GitHub username a long while back,
            because it is distinctly Australian and this one has some great programming hands. 42 is of course the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything,
            as calculated by the supercomputer Deep Thought over a period of 7.5 million years.</p>
