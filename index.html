        <p>Why <a href="https://github.com/Quoll42">Quoll42</a>? &nbspA quoll is a cat-like Australian marsupial that I choose for my GitHub username a long while back,
            because it is distinctly Australian and this one has a great pair of programming hands. 42 is of course the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything,
            as calculated by the supercomputer Deep Thought over a period of 7.5 million years.</p>
